## What is resin.io?

[resin.io][resin] is cloud infrastructure for deploying and updating code and
assets to your devices, wherever they might be.

The architecture of resin consists of loosely connected components which come
together to allow you to focus on deploying code rather than worrying about the
administration of devices, networks, deployment frameworks and security
infrastructure.

Currently the product is in [alpha][ralpha], and we plan to release a beta
version as soon as possible incorporating the experience we've gained while
running the alpha and the feedback of all our fantastic alpha testers.

### Raspberry Pi

Initially we've chosen to focus on the [raspberry pi][rpi] as the first device
we target. There are more than two million of these devices sold worldwide, with
many sat around doing nothing. This makes us sad.
