In order to get your device connected to the resin.io service, you will first need to ensure that the resinOS is flashed onto the devices primary boot medium.

You will also need to ensure that the device can connect to the internet, either via ethernet or wifi. Once these two requirements are satisfied, power on the device, making sure it boots from the primary boot media on which the resinOS was flashed.

In a few minutes you should see your newly provisioned device on the resin.io dashboard. You are now ready to push some code!
