## Setting Up Your Device

Insert the SD card into the {{ $device.name }} baseboard and power it on.

__Note:__ This will also completely erase internal storage media, so please make a backup first.

Press the `POWER` button and hold for one second. This will perform a device shutdown. Once all LEDs are off, remove the SD card.

Power up the {{ $device.name }} again and make sure it is connected to the internet. Your device should appear on the dashboard in about 10 minutes!
