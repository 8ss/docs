To connect with resin.io, your **{{ $device.name }}** will need a resinOS image that is configured for your application and your network. Start by clicking *Download resinOS* in your application dashboard:

<img src="/img/common/app/app_dashboard_empty.png" width="80%">

A list of available versions is shown in the dropdown. In general, the most recent version is recommend.

__Note:__ When you're first getting started, a dev image will be most useful, as it permits a number of development and troubleshooting features. For production use, be sure to switch to prod images. More details on the differences between dev and prod images can be found [here][devvprod].
