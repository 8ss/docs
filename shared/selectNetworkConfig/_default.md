Before your **resinOS** download begins, a prompt will appear asking you to specify how your device will connect to the internet. Currently there are two options:
 * *ethernet:* this option requires no configuration as it is the default.
 * *wifi:* specify the `Wifi SSID` and `Wifi Passphrase` for the network your device will connect to.

Once you have selected a network option, click the *DOWNLOAD RESINOS* button. When the download completes, you should have a zipped image file with a name like `resin-myFleet-2.3.0+rev1-dev-v6.1.3.img.zip`, where `myFleet` is the name you gave your application on the dashboard.
