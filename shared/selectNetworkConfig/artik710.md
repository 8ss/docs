Before your resinOS download begins, a prompt will appear asking you to specify which version of resinOS you want to run and how your device will connect to the internet. 
Make sure to select `Resin OS 2.0.2-beta.2` from the dropdown menu.

Currently there are two connectivity options:
 * Ethernet cable, this option requires *NO* configuration as is the default.
 * Wifi, in which case you must specify the [network name or`SSID`][ssid-link] and `passphrase` for the network your device will connect to.

Once you have selected your connectivity option, click the `Download Device OS` button to get the resin.io operating system image configured for your application and network.

When the download completes you should have a `.img` file with a name like `resin-myFleet-2.0.2-beta.2-2.7.1-f473e316acb9.img` where "myFleet" is the name you gave your application on the dashboard.
