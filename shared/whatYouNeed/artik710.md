* [Samsung ARTIK 710][artik5-spec-link] module mounted on a development board.
* A 5VDC power supply (100-240V input), if you purchased the development kit you should have one included.
* At least one of Wireless communication antennas, also provided as part of the development kit.
* **[optional]** Ethernet cable, if you prefer to **not** connect over wifi.
* A 4GB or larger SD card. All the {{ $device.name }} use a microSD card. The [speed class][sdSpeed] of the card also matters - class 10 card or above is the way to go.
* **[optional]** Its also handy to have a tooth pick or small screw driver to set the tiny boot switches, but you will figure that out later in the guide :)
