* [A Kitra520][kitra520-link] product accelerator development board from [RushUp](http://www.rushup.tech/).
* A micro USB cable.
* **[Optional]** A [2A+ micro USB 5V power supply][psu]
* At least one of Wireless communication antennas, the kit should contain 1 antenna.
* [Samsung ARTIK 5][artik5-eval-link] development carrier board. We recommended either version 3.0-3.3 or version 0.5. This development carrier board is required only for flashing the artik520 module, since the kitra520 carrier board offers only Fastboot flashing, which is currently unsupported on resin.io.
* A 5VDC power supply (100-240V input) with a 5mm DC barrel jack connector.
* **[optional]** Ethernet cable, if you prefer to **not** connect over wifi during provisioning.
* A 4GB or larger SD card to create a boot disk. The [speed class][sdSpeed] of the card is important, a class 10 card or above is the way to go.
* **[optional]** It's also handy to have a tooth pick or small screw driver to set the tiny boot switches of the development board, but you will figure that out later in the guide :)
