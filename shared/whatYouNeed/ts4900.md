* A [TS-4900][TS-link].

* A 4GB or larger SD card. The [TS-4900][TS-link] uses a microSD card. The [speed class][speed_class] of the card also matters - this determines its maximum transfer rate. We strongly recommend you get hold of a class 10 card or above.

* An ethernet cable or WiFi adapter to connect your device to the internet. The internal wifi for the TS-4900 is unstable at moment and there is no easy way of changing the wifi `SSID` and `PASSWORD`, so for the time being, it is recommended that you connect via ethernet.
