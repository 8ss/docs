## Creating an Application

The two key components you will interact with in resin.io are [*applications*][resin-apps] and
[*devices*][resin-devices] - applications represent the code you want to run on your devices, and
devices are the actual hardware itself.

You can have as many devices connected to an application as you like - when you
push code, resin.io deploys to every device that is part of that application.

To create your first application simply type in a name, select the {{ $device_details.name }} type from the drop down list and click the create button. You should now be taken to the dashboard of your newly created application:
