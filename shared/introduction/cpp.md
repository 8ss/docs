## Introduction

In this guide we will build a simple {{ $language.name }} hello world project on a {{ $device.name }}. Along the way you will learn the basics of resin.io. We will walk through getting a {{ $device.name }} online and deploying some {{ $language.name }} code to it.

We will also look into using the built in web terminal to run test commands and debug issues. Once you have a handle on the resin.io deployment workflow, we will introduce you to resin sync and our CLI which will allow you to increase your development speed on resin.io.
