## Introduction [TBD]

In this guide we will build a simple {{ $language_details.name }} web server project on a {{ $device_details.name }}. Along the way you will learn the basics of resin.io.
We will walk you through getting your {{ $device_details.name }} online and deploying your {{ $language_details.name }} code to it.

We will also look into using the built in web terminal to run test commands and debug issues. Once you have a handle on the resin.io deployment workflow, we will introduce you to resin sync which will allow you to increase your development speed on resin.io.
