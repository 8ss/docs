# Introduction

[Resin.io][resin] makes it simple to deploy, update, and maintain code running on remote devices. We are bringing the web development and deployment workflow to hardware, using tools like git and Docker to allow you to seamlessly update all your embedded linux devices in the wild. We handle cross-compilation, device monitoring, VPNs, and log collection, so you can focus on your product and not the infrastructure.

To get started with resin.io, first read [understanding resin.io][understanding] or you can jump right in with [installing resin.io][installing] to start provisioning some devices and pushing code.

If you need to work out which base image to use, check out our [base images documentation](/runtime/resin-base-images) which lists all of our base images including many specialised ones for e.g. node, python, go, smaller images, etc.

Have fun!

If you have any further questions drop us a mail at **hello@resin.io**.
