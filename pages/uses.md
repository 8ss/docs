# Uses of Resin.io

Resin.io is useful wherever it would be useful to have the capacity to deploy to and maintain code on one or more remote devices. This is a pretty broad range of possibilities - even a device in the same room as you may be useful to be under Resin.io's control.

It's important to consider the different users of Resin.io - uses vary a huge amount in what they want to achieve depending on their background and motivation.

## Consumers

For the time-being, we are focused on focusing on developers, however we see no reason why non-technical users couldn't make use of Resin.io to deploy pre-built software for their devices managed via a customer-facing dashboard.

Initially however, our target consumers are hobbyist 'hackers' (in the sense of a sub-culture of people who enjoy solving problems :) who want to experiment with different projects and maintain the freedom to tweak these to their heart's desire.

Obvious initial hobbyist uses are things like home automation - opening and closing curtains on a set schedule, monitoring energy usage throughout the house, turning on the heating before you get home, pinging you when the washing is done, etc. as well as the more 'fun' stuff like controlling a fleet of drones or hacking together a tetris game on the windows on the side of your college dorm :)

A number of websites already provide detailed guides on hacking together these kinds of hobbyist projects, Resin.io makes deploying and tinkering with these significantly easier and acts as the glue to draw people into hacking on their devices after a long day's work.

## Industry

Industrial uses take us from the fun stuff to the seriously useful and profitable stuff.

As discussed in Marco Annunziata's excellent [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/marco_annunziata_welcome_to_the_age_of_the_industrial_internet), the age of the 'industrial internet' is nothing short of a paradigm shift.

It's quite galling to contemplate the cost businesses endure (and tragically the lives people sometimes lose) due to faulty parts that don't get picked up quickly enough or aren't fixed correctly.

Having an 'intelligent device' makes an enormous difference here - consider an aircraft engine which continuously monitors the performance of its components - it detects that a fan blade is worn beyond acceptable levels (but still within a margin of safety), contacts the airline's maintenance department at the destination airport, ensures the part is available there and then uses their scheduling software to schedule maintenance on arrival.

Think of the benefits - the time (and hence money) lost due to defects being detected only on attempted departure are significant, and the risks associated with actually taking off with the problem *not* detected are vastly more severe.

The fact that this is software gives us further advantages - the expertise of the best engineers at the engine manufacturer can be used to monitor a number of factors that a maintenance engineer simply couldn't be expected to be aware of let alone have the time to check, not to mention the fact that the software can monitor the engine in operation as well as on the ground and compare to projected models in whatever way the engineers prefer.

Another big advantage in using software for this task is that improvements can be added over time - even the best maintenance engineers (and pilots on external inspection before a flight) can't be expected to pick up on every possible issue, let alone a growing number as new potential issues arise.

The scaling is excellent also - duplicating excellent engineers is difficult/impossible, duplicating software/hardware configurations is trivial. Once you work out the setup for a single aircraft, it can be used on every airlines' fleet of that class of aircraft.

Another industrial example is the use of intelligent devices implanted in ordinary factory devices - the kind of advantages that are found in the aircraft engine example I gave above are equally applicable to the thousands of factories manufacturing products around the world - the potential savings are colossal, GE recently [issued a report](http://www.ideaslaboratory.com/2012/11/26/ge-report-industrial-internet-could-add-10-15-trillion-to-global-gdp/) suggesting that $10-15tn could be added to global GDP alone. Even if this off by an order of magnitude, the savings involved are staggering.
