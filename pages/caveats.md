# Caveats

The first and most important point to highlight is that Resin.io is in __alpha__ and thus should not be used for anything even remotely critical.

We plan to release a beta version soon which ought to reduce the number of caveats, however the caution with regard to critical work will remain in place until we release a production version.

## OS Updates

When we release new version of the install image you may need to manually updated your SD cards. We expect to remove this limitation once the beta version is available.

## Reliability

While our infrastructure matures we expect we will suffer from occasional outages.

We will endeavour to keep you informed as and when this occurs and ensure we never fail for the same reason twice.

## API Stability

The programming conventions and interfaces we use are likely to change over time as we learn from real-world use cases.

While we will not break backwards compatibility lightly, we value a clean experience and reserve the right to break existing conventions when necessary during the early stages of our development process.
