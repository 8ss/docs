# Projects Built on Resin.io

## Installing a Project

To install a project you will need a [Resin.io][resin] account with an
application set up ready to receive code. See the
[getting started][getting-started] and [deployment][deploy] guides for details
on how to do this.

To deploy a project simply clone it and push it to your application's `resin`
endpoint. E.g. for the [Text to Speech Converter project][text2speech]:-

```
git clone https://github.com/resin-io/text2speech.git .
git remote add resin [endpoint]
git push resin master
```

## Programming Language Starter Projects

Below is a list of simple 'Hello, World' projects written in a number of
different programming languages, which are designed to form the basis of your
own projects written in each language.

The projects use [Dockerfile][dockerfile]s to install packages and configure the
local environment as needed for each language. This step is performed on the
Resin.io build server and the finished product is pushed to your devices.

A link is provided for each project's individual Dockerfile below for easy
customisation:-
