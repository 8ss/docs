# Upcoming Additions

However this is not all. Resin is built with the goal of 100% updateability, so while the resin agent and the user’s application container are easy to switch out, this doesn’t extend to the kernel or the host OS. To deal with this, Resin creates an additional partition of identical size to the boot partition. A future version of our agent will be able to download a new OS version, and make the device boot from the alternative boot partition. In this way we can ensure that the new version of the OS is downloaded and installed correctly before rebooting the device to the new version. Even if the new version fails to boot for some reason, our system is built in such a way that the next boot will bring the device back to the original working version of the host OS, operating and ready to download the corrected new version.
